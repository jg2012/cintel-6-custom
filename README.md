The purpose of this project is to work with an interactive online tool by [Shiny for Python](https://shiny.posit.co/py/). 

This app imports data through a CSV file obtained through the [U.S. Department of Energy: Alternative Fuel Data Center] (https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity-locations#/analyze). The app shows a Dashboard that contains a data table, a map, and a plot.  The user is able to interact with the app by filtering by city or state.  The Dashboard will generate the data, place a marker on the locations of the EV charging stations and plot the total count of charging stations in the plot.
